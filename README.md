# Hospital Database Management System

This project is a Hospital Database Management System developed as a mini-project for academic purposes. It encompasses the design, implementation, and management of hospital operations, providing an efficient system for healthcare providers.

## Features

- **Database Operations**: Implements CRUD operations for hospital data, including patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records.
- **Frontend Integration**: Uses PHP for dynamic and interactive web-based interface.
- **Database Design**:
  - Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram for conceptual design.
  - Normalization of relations to ensure data consistency and reduce redundancy.
- **Security**: Includes basic authentication and ensures data integrity.
- **Dynamic Data Connectivity**: Integrates with MySQL for backend database management.

## Code Structure

1. **ER Diagram & Normalization**:
   - ER Diagram provides a high-level overview of entities and relationships.
   - Database schema normalized up to the third normal form (3NF).

2. **Frontend**:
   - Developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Responsive design and user-friendly forms for managing hospital data.

3. **Backend**:
   - MySQL database for storing and retrieving hospital records.
   - Table creation and tuple insertion scripts provided.

4. **Features**:
   - Appointment booking system.
   - Patient, doctor, and admin panels.
   - Generate and manage medical records.

## Requirements

### Software Requirements
